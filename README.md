# Machine-Learning
Here you'll find codes and data related to the topics of ML. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

1.Supervised Learning: Example problems are classification and regression. Example algorithms include: Logistic Regression and the Back Propagation Neural Network.
2.Unsupervised Learning: Example problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction and association rule learning. Example algorithms include: the Apriori algorithm and K-Means.
3.Semi-Supervised Learning: Example problems are classification and regression. Example algorithms are extensions to other flexible methods that make assumptions about how to model the unlabeled data.
